🌸 1. Aesthetic & UX Direction

Your color palette conveys:

Warmth & empathy — encourages consistency without stress.

Calm motivation — the pink tones give it a sense of gentleness, which aligns with “building habits with grace.”

Soft accountability — fits the “self-kindness” vibe rather than “discipline and punishment.”

To make it work:

Primary background: #F7CACD (Tea Rose Red) – calming and light.

Accent or button color: #F29CA3 (Salmon Pink).

Highlight / active state: #D2899D (Puce).

Text color: Deep neutral gray (#3A3A3A or similar).

Progress / streak indicator gradient: from #B17596 to #F5B3B8 (Mountbatten → Cherry Blossom).

→ This creates a soothing visual hierarchy while keeping clarity for a productivity app.
